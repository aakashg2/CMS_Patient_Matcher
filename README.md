In this project, I use public CMS Physician data to create a randomized forest that can predict a speciality of a physician based on their metadata, their financial policies, and the types of procedures that they do
I also use clustering to group cardiologists into subclusters and use a method that can match patients to a cardiologists that best fits their need.
